# Learnig rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is an exciting new language that provides low level control without compromising any high level functionality

## Salient features
* Statically and strongly typed
* Focused on performance and safety (binaries are almost as fast as C/C++!)
* Memory and thread safety is guaranteed at compile time (no segfaults :partying_face:)
